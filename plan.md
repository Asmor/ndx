  - [x] MAJOR: Serializing characters is bad, qualities are replaced with powers!
    - [ ] Also, handle bad value in local storage more gracefully. Maybe an error boundary? Present the saved data so it can be copied/edited?

    - [d] Address "bad pow"/"bad qual" errors
  - [x] Scroll bars showing up all over the place for bunny and alex
