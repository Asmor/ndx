- Bugs
  - [x] MAJOR: Serializing characters is bad, qualities are replaced with powers!
    - [ ] Also, handle bad value in local storage more gracefully. Maybe an error boundary? Present the saved data so it can be copied/edited?
  - [ ] Improve error messages from parsing character, particulary wrt misleading errors caused by the optional nature of the abilities' required section
    - [x] Address "bad pow"/"bad qual" errors
  - [x] Scroll bars showing up all over the place for bunny and alex
  - [x] Alex's powers too wide for the abilities section?
  - [x] Long power names cause issues
