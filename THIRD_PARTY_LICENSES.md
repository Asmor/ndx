## Development Dependencies (tools only, not distributed with runtime build)

All development tools used in this project are also under permissive licenses (MIT or similar), including:

- TypeScript
- Vite
- Vitest
- ESLint + plugins
- Prettier
- Sass
- Happy DOM

Because these tools are not included in the distributed runtime, their licenses are not reproduced here, but they remain available in their respective repositories.
